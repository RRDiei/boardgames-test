# The Boardgame Database

## A Vite + React Test Project

This is a test application to showcase Vite + React. It consists of a fake boardgames database website where you can see boardgames, add new ones and add reviews.

A JSON file is used as a fake backend database for this project, and all modifications will be distroyed on refresh.

The project uses react-router and tailwincss.

Enjoy!
